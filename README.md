This is the source code for Alfred. 
The goal of this project was to create a Robotic Butler that can autonomously retrieve a cup of coffee.

In order for our source code to work, you must download the ROS AMCL and Hector_slam packages. These are part of the ROS Navigation Stack. You will also need RVIZ and some kind of laser scan device (we used a Robopeak RPLIDAR). In order for the Hector_slam to work with our codes, you must already have a map of the room. The "slam.launch" file can be used to map the room. Details are provided in the "Documentation" tab on our website "personalbutler.tk".
